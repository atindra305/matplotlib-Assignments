1. Plot the probabilities of all the numbers from the file. (First two graphs)

2. Compare the probability plot with the histogram plot. (Plot the histogram of the numbers in the file and look for similarities between the probability plot and the histogram plot). (Last Graph)

3. For the paragraph given in the text file (Input_Text), find every single unique word. Subsequently, compute the set of neighbours for each word containing its next word, and calculate the probability of each word in the set.
